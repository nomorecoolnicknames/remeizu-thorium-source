# ReMeizu thorium: Android 9 source checkpoint

This branch publishes the actual Android 9 device/common adaptation source from private development commit `22d8906039b2010cc252556e391c0fd9ef7f386f`. It is a source review checkpoint, not a downloadable ROM or a claim of successful boot. Original private development history is preserved; this public branch starts from an audited source export so private files are not present in ancestor commits.

The tree contains product and board configuration, init/SELinux wiring and compatibility code. The common/thin-device layout includes M3s, U10 and U20 LOS16 graph diagnostics. Stock graph products are diagnostic; their source does not establish custom-kernel or device readiness.

## Inputs and status

Prebuilt kernels, shared libraries, compiled SELinux databases, firmware, stock archives and private operational evidence are deliberately absent. No vendor blobs or private Git history are included. `SOURCE_PROVENANCE.json` records exact upstream commit, source file hashes, exclusions and limited identifier redactions. Existing references to excluded inputs remain explicit and must be satisfied separately; they have not been replaced with success stubs.

A complete Android build still requires the matching LineageOS platform, appropriate kernel source/build output and device-specific proprietary inputs. The snapshot alone is not a blob-free ROM build recipe. For open-source-only infrastructure, restrict jobs to selected openly licensed code, source checks and separately audited GPL kernel builds; do not run stock extraction or import firmware there. Retain existing per-file copyright and license notices; this export does not relicense inherited files.

Historical notes may describe previous experiments. They do not certify the current branch on hardware. Common-tree board inheritance is not proof that M6, M3s, U10 or U20 have identical wiring.
