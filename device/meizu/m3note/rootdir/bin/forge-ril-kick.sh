# forge: bring telephony up after boot on m681.
#
# Workaround for two defects that are still open; both are documented in
# docs/M681_DAILY_DRIVER_STATUS.md sections 11.240 and 11.241. Delete the
# matching block here when its defect is fixed, do not leave it to rot.
#
#  1. rild deadlocks during its first start on AT channel contention
#     ("E/AT: Occupied Thread: AT+CPIN? send on RIL_CMD_READER_3") and then
#     sits idle for minutes. One restart clears it - but only if the modem is
#     already up. v1 of this script restarted it 20 s after boot_completed,
#     which is BEFORE gsm0710muxd has opened the AT channels, and the fresh
#     rild parked exactly like the deadlocked one: two boots logged
#     "sim.state= after 40 polls". So wait for the mux to exist first, and
#     wait on states rather than on guessed delays.
#  2. DcTracker builds no APN list (EF_ICCID unreadable -> no ICCID -> no
#     active subscription) and feeds the modem AOSP's "this_is_an_invalid_apn"
#     placeholder, which the network refuses, so the LTE attach never
#     completes. Writing the real APN straight to the modem lets it through.

# mal-mfi for mal-daemon from the same directory. Why init skips it is NOT
# established; this widens one tmpfs directory by one group instead of
# guessing. Remove it the moment the init side is understood.
